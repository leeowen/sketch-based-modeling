\section{Introduction}

With the rapid progress of Internet technology, large-scale visual data can be found on the Internet, bringing significant opportunities for novel processing of visual information, as well as commercial applications.
The Computational Visual Media Conference series, of which this is to be the first conference, is intended to provide a major new international forum for exchanging novel research ideas and significant practical results both underpinning and applying Visual Media. The primary rationale for this new conference series is to target cross disciplinary research which amalgamates aspects of computer graphics, computer vision, machine learning, image processing, video processing, visualization and geometric computing. Original research is sought in areas concerning the classification, composition, retrieval, synthesis, and understanding of visual media.

\subsection{Date}
Computational Visual Media Conference will be held on xxx to xxx.

\subsection{Language}
English is the official language of the conference.

\section{About the paper submission}

\subsection{Paper length}
cvm papers may be between 4 pages and 14 pages. Over length papers will simply not be reviewed.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Draft and final copy}
The \LaTeX\ style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the
version submitted for review.  The ruler is provided in order that
reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without
circumlocution. The camera ready copy should not contain a ruler.
(\LaTeX\ users may uncomment the \verb'\cvmfinalcopy' command in the document preamble.)

\subsection{Blind review}
Many authors misunderstand the concept of anonymizing for blind
review.  Blind review does not mean that one must remove
citations to one's own work---in fact it is often impossible to
review a paper unless the previous citations are known and
available.
Blind review means that you do not use the words ``my'' or ``our''
when citing previous work.

\subsection{Miscellaneous}

\noindent
Compare the following:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \verb'$conf_a$' &  $conf_a$ \\
 \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
\end{tabular}\\
See The \TeX book, p165.

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a
sentence-ending space. So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.  The provided
\verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'',
shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word.)
However, use it only when there are three or more authors.  Thus, the
following is correct: ``
   Frobnication has been trendy lately.
   It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
   Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...''
because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.  If you use the
\verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods
when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.

For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not
chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors12} to
\cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Authors12}.

\subsection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times,
single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text,
enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
example~\cite{Authors12}.  Where appropriate, include the name(s) of
editors of referenced books.

A & OK\\
B & Bad \\
Ours & Great\\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered.  Please ensure that any point you wish to
make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.  Resize fonts in figures
to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths which render
effectively in print.  Many readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic
copy, will choose to print your paper in order to read it.  You cannot
insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can
zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use
\verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the  figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
}
